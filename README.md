# Hello! We are *the_restorators*. 

This is the project part of the 2023 training course, Deep Learning for Microscopy Image Analysis at Marine Biological Laboratory. Read more [here][https://www.mbl.edu/education/advanced-research-training-courses/course-offerings/dlmbl-deep-learning-microscopy-image-analysis]. 

What we want to accomplish learning: 
1. Basic supervised learning 
2. Improving generalizability of the model: Domain adaptation, pre-training, and fine-tuning

Proposed plan

1) Train a U-Net with your own dataset and assess the performance. 
2) Use a pre-trained network from other members and fine-tune it for your dataset: we can try all the different combinations. We can try different pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. Then, assess the performance. 
3) We create a confusion matrix of all these learning conditions and evaluate which method is the best. 

Bonus challenge:
Investigate how we can train one generalist network that performs almost as well as specialist networks.
